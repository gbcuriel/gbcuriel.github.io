            <h2>What is Blacksmithing?</h2>
            <p>Blacksmithing is an ancient craft centered regarding the creation of tools, weapons, and armor from
                various materials mainly metals. It is a practical trade and an art form focused on transforming raw
                metal into items that are either functional, decorative, or a combination of both.</p>
            <p>The basic process is heating the metal in a forge until it becomes malleable so it to be shaped with a
                hammer and anvil. When the desired shape is achieved the metal is cooled locking in its new shape. A
                smith can forge an endless array of items, including durable tools, custom knives, and beautiful
                decorative ironwork.</p>
            <p>Some of the commonly used tools are:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
                <li>Hammer</li>
                <li>Anvil</li>
                <li>Forge</li>
                <li>Tongs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Becomes a Smith?</h2>
            <p>In medieval times the blacksmith was an important member of the community, their forge was usually a
                popular hub as many people would require their services. These smiths would make armor and weapons for
                their lords and knights. For the common folk a smith would sell horseshoes, nails, cart peices, etc.</p>
            <p>With the industrial Revolution came mass production of metal works where massive factories with large
                machinery and large workforces produced products for many large scale metalworks. Industial smiths are
                usually people who are well versed in repairing the machinery or handling flow of material through
                presses and the like</p>
            <p>Today the old manner of blacksmithing is most often found with hobbyists. People who either want to make
                art or replicate tools and weapons from popular media, these are most easily found at places like the
                Renaissance Faire and similar where people enjoy the old ways.</p>

            <h2>Forging History</h2>
            <p>The story of blacksmithing is deeply interwoven with the timeline of human civilization, evolving
                dramatically from its earliest sparks to its modern revival. In the Bronze Age (starting around 3300
                BC), the earliest metalworkers were not yet shaping iron, but were pioneering the discovery of smelting
                and the casting of copper, tin, and later bronze. This period saw the creation of foundational tools and
                early weaponry, laying the groundwork for the more formidable metals to come.
                </br></br>With the dawn of the Iron Age (circa 1200 BC), the true blacksmith emerged, mastering the
                high heats required to work iron. This breakthrough marked a transformative era, as smiths began forging
                stronger tools for agriculture and more potent weapons, fundamentally altering societal development and
                daily life.
                </br></br>During the Medieval Period (roughly 500-1500 AD), the blacksmith became the indispensable
                heartbeat of every village and castle. Their forges hummed with activity, producing everything from
                vital farming implements like plowshares and axes to the complex armor, swords, and intricate ironwork
                that defined the era's craftsmanship and warfare. This was a time when the smith's skill was paramount
                to survival and progress.
                </br></br>The Industrial Revolution (from approximately 1760 AD) ushered in a radical shift, as
                individual craftsmanship gave way to mass production. Giant steam hammers and hydraulic presses in vast
                factories churned out train rails, structural girders, and uniform machine parts. The scale of
                metalworking became immense, focused on efficiency and standardization rather than individual artistry,
                fundamentally reshaping global industries and infrastructure.
                </br></br>Finally, the Modern Era (20th Century - Today) has seen a profound resurgence of
                blacksmithing, not out of necessity, but as a passionate hobby and respected art form. Contemporary
                smiths, often working in smaller, independent shops, are dedicated to preserving historical techniques,
                exploring new artistic expressions, and finding deep personal satisfaction in transforming metal with
                their own hands, bridging ancient traditions with innovative designs and advanced alloys.</p>

            <h2>Where to Set Up a Forge?</h2>
            <p>Probably the most common forge is found in peoples sheds and garages, these forges are spaces that can be
                easily ventilated or opened should they get to hot. In these forges depending on the amount of
                dedication and time set in the forge you may or may not find large tools and larger varieties. The image
                below depicts a well used/experienced forge. As seen the forge has a stone floor as minimizing flamable
                objects is crucial.</p>

                large machinery. The floor would be made of dirt or gravel and the forge itself would likely be a
                glorified fireplace, these forges are easier to work in for long periods of time.</p>

            <h2>How to Forge a Simple Knife</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Safety First: This is a beginner's project, but not a day-one project.</strong> Before
                attempting this,
                you must be comfortable with controlling your fire and hammer. Bladesmithing introduces new risks,
                especially
                during the oil quench. Always wear your **PPE** (safety glasses, leather gloves, natural fiber clothing)
                and
                ensure your workspace has excellent ventilation and a fire extinguisher nearby.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Design and Forge the Profile:</strong> Start with a small bar of high-carbon steel, like
                    1084. Heat
                    one end to a bright orange and use your hammer to forge a point. Then, working from the point
                    backward,
                    establish the rough shape of your knife and its "full tang" (where the handle will be the same shape
                    as the
                    steel). Focus on keeping the blade straight and flat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Refine the Shape:</strong> After the blade cools, use a grinder or files to refine the
                    profile to
                    your exact design. This is the best time to drill holes through the tang for the handle pins, as the
                    steel
                    is still in its soft, unhardened state.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Normalize the Steel:</strong> To relieve stress from forging and grinding, you must
                    normalize the
                    blade. Heat the entire knife evenly until a magnet will no longer stick to it, then let it cool to
                    room
                    temperature in still air. Repeat this process a total of three times for a tough, reliable grain
                    structure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Harden the Blade (The Quench):</strong> This is the most critical step. Reheat the blade
                    evenly to
                    the non-magnetic temperature one last time. Swiftly plunge it, edge-first, into a container of
                    canola or
                    quenching oil until it is completely cool. At this point, the steel should be as hard as glass and
                    very
                    brittle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Temper the Blade:</strong> To remove the brittleness and add toughness, you must temper the
                    blade.
                    Clean the steel so it's shiny, then place it in a preheated oven at 400°F (204°C) for two separate,
                    two-hour
                    cycles, letting it cool to room temperature in between. The steel should turn a light straw or
                    bronze color,
                    indicating a successful temper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Finish and Sharpen:</strong> With the heat treatment complete, the final step is to use
                    files or a
                    belt sander to clean up the blade, sharpen the final edge, and attach handle scales (wood or
                    synthetic
                    material) to the tang with pins and epoxy.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why Pick Up the Hammer?</h2>
            <p>Many people watch smithing on youtube as its a satisfying process and some like myself think why not give
                it a go. I started with the Dragonforge Experience at the NC Renaissance Faire and it was a wonderful
                expeience that really hooked me and I walked away with a VERY sharp rail spike.</p>
            <p>I encourage everyone to try it if they can there are many classes or places that offer short expeiences
                so a person can get the feel of smithing and more often then not walk away with a simple knife or
                pendent of their own creation. It is extremely satisfying to have proof of ones hardwork that can be
                displayed and admired not to mention the most satifying rining of metal on metal and the power that
                comes from bending steel to your will.</p>

                                ACCORDINGLY.

                                You may/should use AI for this :)

                                Think of an activity that you are passionate about. If you don't have one, figure one
                                out and fake it.

                                Make a subfolder in your course folder called hobby

                                Within that folder create an images folder (and others as you see fit).

                                Create an index page that includes all the normal items our pages have had so far – do
                                not use includes.

                                header/main/footer within the body

                                header tag should have an h1 with the name of the hobby

                                footer tag should include validation buttons (HTML, CSS, accessibility) and a link to
                                your design firm as you did with
                                the course website.

                                The page must validate with no warnings/errors (HTML, CSS, accessibility).

                                Use an embedded stylesheet since this is all one page.

                                Styling should follow CRAP principles.

                                No Times New Roman, no generic blue underlined links, no plain white background, no
                                plain black text.

                                Color scheme must be different than your main site pages.

                                Create sections (using <section> tags) that act like different “pages” for your hobby
                                    site:

                                    Who (About / About Me / Who We Are)

                                    What (Home page – loads first, explains the hobby)

                                    When (Best Times / Schedule / Seasons)

                                    Where (Best Locations / Places)

                                    How

                                    Why

                                    AI Prompts (if you used AI for code or text, show prompts here. If only images were
                                    AI-generated, include a comment
                                    in your submission that says “I only used AI for images.”)

                                    Each section should:

                                    Have an h2 heading.

                                    Contain at least three items (e.g., paragraphs, figures, tables, forms, slideshow).

                                    Include at least one figure (image + caption + italicized paragraph explaining the
                                    AI prompt used).

                                    Images must be your own, AI-generated, or open source. Keep a consistent style
                                    (e.g., all photorealistic or all
                                    cartoon).

                                    Resize large images and maintain aspect ratio to avoid long loading times.

                                    Navigation:

                                    Add links in the header/nav to switch between sections.

                                    Use CSS/JS so only the selected section is visible at a time (like a single-page
                                    app).

                                    Use a unique divider symbol (emoji or special character) different from your other
                                    pages.
